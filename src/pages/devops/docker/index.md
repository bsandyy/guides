## Docker

### What is Docker:
Docker is the most used and well defined containerization platform. It helps both developer and operation teams to streamline their daily workflows.

### What is containerization then:
SImply put, it is nothing more than packaging of a process/application and it's dependencies into a distributable image which can run in isolation. 

### Why do we need Docker:
It makes the life of software engineers very smooth as they will always work on the same development environment. 
It helps in sharing the final product to customers/other teams without worrying about environment issues.
It reduces the amount of hardware we need to run our applications by not wasting them for unnecessary OS layer.
